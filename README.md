# Course-Scraper

A python script that scrapes course data from saved html files. Code is hacky and ugly, but as far as I know it works for the html files of https://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c09066.html https://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c09067.html https://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c10066.html https://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c10408.html. Repository also contains the data scraped from these courses.
